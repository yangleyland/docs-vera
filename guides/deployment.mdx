description: "Build and deploy Quote Generator to production"
---

Quote Generator is a standard Create React App project, so it can be deployed to any static hosting service.

## Building for production

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `build` folder containing:
- Minified JavaScript bundles
- Optimized CSS
- Static assets (images, icons)
- An `index.html` entry point

<Note>
  The build process optimizes your app for the best performance. Files are minified and filenames include hashes for cache busting.
</Note>

### Docker

Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t quote-generator .
docker run -p 8080:80 quote-generator
```

## Environment variables

If you add environment variables (for example, API keys), prefix them with `REACT_APP_`:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Access them in your code:

```javascript
const apiKey = process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY;
```

<Warning>
  Never commit sensitive environment variables to your repository. Use `.env.local` for local development and set production variables in your hosting platform's dashboard.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails to minify

If you encounter minification errors:

1. Check for syntax errors in your JavaScript
2. Ensure all dependencies are compatible with your Node version
3. Try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again

### Blank page after deployment

If your deployed app shows a blank page:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify the `homepage` field in `package.json` matches your deployment URL
3. Ensure all asset paths are relative (the build process handles this automatically)
