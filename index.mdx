Quote Generator is a React application that presents users with random quotes, each displayed with a unique, dynamically changing background color. Click a button to get a new quote and watch the entire interface transform.

## How it works

The app maintains a list of quotes and tracks which ones have been shown. When you click "New Quote":

1. A random unvisited quote is selected
2. A new background color is chosen from the color palette
3. Both the quote text and all colored elements update simultaneously
4. Once all quotes have been shown, the cycle resets
